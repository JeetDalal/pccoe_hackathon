# Ultrasound Image Analysis For Detection of Down Syndrome

## Project Description

The idea for using ultrasound to spot Down syndrome came from realizing that current methods aren't perfect. They can be inaccurate and hard to access, especially in some areas. We thought we could do better by using new technology like ultrasound and smart computer programs. We talked to doctors, engineers, and computer experts to make sure our idea was solid. Some of us were also personally motivated, maybe because we knew someone with Down syndrome or just really wanted to help. Our goal is to make it easier to find Down syndrome early and help people get the support they need.

## Features

- **High Resolution Imaging**: Utilization of high-resolution ultrasound imaging technology to capture detailed anatomical structures and physiological characteristics of the fetal brain.
- **Segmentation Techniques**: Implementation of segmentation techniques to isolate specific regions of interest within ultrasound images, such as the ventricles, cerebellum, or corpus callosum.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Integration of machine learning algorithms, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for automated analysis and classification of ultrasound images based on extracted features.
- **Classification of Abnormalities**: Classification of abnormalities in fetal brain development, such as ventriculomegaly, agenesis of the corpus callosum, or cerebellar abnormalities, using trained models.
